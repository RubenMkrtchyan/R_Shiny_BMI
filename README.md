In this repository I have put my R Shiny project of Developing Data Products course which is offered by John Hopkins University via Coursera. I have created a shiny app which calculates BMI score of the person based on the input values - height and body weight. The app is deployed at shinyapps.io and the link is here: https://rubenmkrtchyan.shinyapps.io/r_shiny_bmi/
Moreover, there is a short presentation of the project and the github pages link is here: https://rubenmkrtchyan.github.io/R_Shiny_BMI/R_shiny_bmi.html
You can find server.R, ui.R, .Rmd and .html files in this repository.
